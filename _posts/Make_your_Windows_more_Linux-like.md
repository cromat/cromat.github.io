If you are, like me, working in a corporate environment, there is a big chance that you are obligated to use Windows OS with all its utilities. I am Linux user for about 3 years and for me as a software developer
it is much easier and practical to use a Linux distro for daily work. Here, I will put a list of stuff that made my Windows (7) pc more Linux-like wich is boosting my daily performance at work. This tips can also
be used on Windows Vista, 8 and 10.


1. Cmder (http://cmder.net)

As their title says, it's aportable console emulator for Windows. It is based on ConEmu and spiced up with Monokai color scheme and custom prompt layout. It supports multiple tabs, splitting and emulating of any 
shell/console that you have installed. You can also configure your default starting console e.g. cygwin. 
Some helpful stuff about Cmder:
    - To add default startup console right-click on taskbar (or press Win + Alt + p) > Settings > Startup > Specified named task > choose your console
    - To switch between tabs you can use Ctrl + Tab
    - To add new tab press Ctrl + t
    - To close tab press Ctrl + w
    - Fast new tab Shift + Alt + number (1. CMD, 2. Git Bash)
